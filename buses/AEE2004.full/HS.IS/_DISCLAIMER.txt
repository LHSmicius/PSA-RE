Playing with the IS bus can be dangerous, and improper wiring can cause important systems like ABS, ESP, power steering, the engine control unit, and possibly the BSI (electrical hearth of your car) to malfunction or, in the worst case, to burn out some chips on them!

We do not recommend you to connect to this bus if you are not 100% certain what you are about to do.
We are NOT responsible for any damage done or any wrong information obtained here!
