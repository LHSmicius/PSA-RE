# PSA car naming

Apparently, the code is such

* One letter, and one number, that's the base model
* Maybe a 2nd number if there's multiple body types
* * 0 for 3 doors
* * 1 for 5 doors
* * 2 for SW/Break
* * 3 for 4 doors
* * 4 for leisure/minivan/big utility
* * 5 for Coupe
* * 6 for Coupe/Cabriolet (convertible)
* * 7 for Cabriolet (convertible)
* * 8 for Monospace/Minispace
* * 9 for (small) utility

Restyling often (but not always) only increment the (first) number by 1
